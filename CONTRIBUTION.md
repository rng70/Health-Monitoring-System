***This file is only for contributors of this project***



Want to contribute to the project?

There are a few things you need to know and they are listed below



### Open Development

---

All work of the project happens directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/rng70/Health-Monitoring-System). All contributors should send pull requests which go through the same review process or called “Peer Review”.



### Naming Convention

---

For keeping everything clean and structured we use “Lower Camel Case Naming Convention” for this project.

If you don’t know what is “Camel Case Naming Convention”, then have a look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).



### Branch Organization

---

Submit all commits directly to the “development” branch or create a new branch of your own and then commit to the branch and then request for a review process. 

When the review process is complete then ‘Create a pull request’ and marge to the ‘main/master’ branch

Before push you don’t need to pull every time but if you want to keep your local branch up-to-date then pull master branch after every successful merge.
